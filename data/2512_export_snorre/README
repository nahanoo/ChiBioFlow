Conditions

This folder contains the data for the chemostat experiments for different medium conditions.
Conditions:
	- No carbon source
	- Acetate 45 mM
	- Ribose 18 mM
	- Histidine 15 mM
	- Glutaric acid 18 mM

Protocol

I started the chemostat experiments on Mondays (T0) and stopped them on Thrusday.
I sample the experiment starting from Tuesday where the system is usually already at steady state. Starting from Tuesday, I did two samples per day, of which I did CFUs. Once per day, I measured the OD on a plate reader. You can find the labbook entries as PDF exports in the protocols folder

Data

You can find the CFU data and the OD data from the daily plate readings in the dataframes folder. The CFU dataframes split by condition contains following columns:

['species', 'reactor', 'sample_time', 'average', 'stdev', 'count','dilution']

Average: Average CFUs/mL for three dilutions (three 5 uL spots on one agar plate)
Stdev: Square root of the sample variance (stdev function from statistics in python)
count: Counted colonies
dilution: In which dilution colonies were counted

Plots
In the plots directory you can find a plot of the CFUs in svg format.
